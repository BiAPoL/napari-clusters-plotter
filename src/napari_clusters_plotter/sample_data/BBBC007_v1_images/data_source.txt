We used image set BBBC007v1 image set version 1 (Jones et al., Proc. ICCV Workshop on Computer Vision for Biomedical Image Applications, 2005), available from the Broad Bioimage Benchmark Collection [Ljosa et al., Nature Methods, 2012].

Some images (17P1_POS0006_D_1UL, 17P1_POS0014_D_1UL, 20P1_POS0005_D_1UL, 20P1_POS0010_D_1UL, 20P1_POS0011_D_1UL) were converted from RGB to grayscale (8-bit).
